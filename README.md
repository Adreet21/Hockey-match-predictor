# Hockey match predictor<br>
We made an NHL match predictor. It takes in the data of the last 2 years of all the hockey matches and learns from it to predict the outcome of upcoming matches.
It uses web scraping to gather all the data about the matches already played and the upcoming match schedules.
Then an ML model is used to predict the upcoming matches with high accuracy.


## Why we needed Web Scraping?<br>
To gather all the previous match data we scrapped the Official NHL website to gather all the necessary data and make a CSV file.<br>
Additionally, we used web scraping again to get the upcoming match schedule for our ML model to predict.

## What did we do with the ML model?
We trained the model using the previous match data (2022, 2023) from a CSV file that we made by scraping the Official NHL website. We then used the trained model to predict the upcoming matches in 2024. The model works with high accuracy as we used excellent predictors to train and test the model.


## How did we implement it?<br>
We then made a website where all the features tie together and give you a very nice user experience, where you can interact with the website and look the upcoming match you want to know about.

                                                                  
## Installation

@maher complete this installation part so that even Tanjil can run this.


## Output

You can send up to 1000 coins. with Multiple transactions. After you finish all your money the program will end and it will say if the block that you used was valid(Not tampered with).<br>
