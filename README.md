# Hockey match predictor

We made an NHL match predictor. It takes in the data of the last 2 years of all the hockey matches and learns from it to predict the outcome of upcoming matches.
It uses web scraping to gather all the data about the matches already played and the upcoming match schedules.
Then the ML model reads and learns from the data to train itself. This model is then used to predict the model with high accuracy.


## What is Web Scraping?<br>
A web scraper automates the extraction of data from websites by retrieving and parsing HTML material before storing it in a structured format. Its applications include market research, Competitive Analysis, SEO Monitoring, and more.

###


## How did we implement it?<br>
I used each block in the blockchain to keep the transaction data.
Each block in the blockchain contains one transaction.

I used the SHA-256 algorithm to a string to create hash values for the blocks,<br> 
apply the ECDSA Signature and verify a string signature to ensure the data was not tampered with.<br>

                                                                  
## Installation

Make a clone of all the files in the repository.<br>

You need to have Java and JDK installed.

You have to add the JAR files in the "libs" file in your java library.<br>
OR<br>
If you are using vscode you can drag and drop the libs file in the reference folder under the java project section.

After it is done next you will have to run the BlockChain.java and wait for the output in the terminal.

## Output

After successfully running the code, in the terminal, there should be a prompt asking how much money you want to transfer to wallet B.<br>
You can send up to 1000 coins. with Multiple transactions. After you finish all your money the program will end and it will say if the block that you used was valid(Not tampered with).<br>
